# Rewrite to rust

(Re)writing stuff in/to rust, cause why not?

## Why Rust?

Software job > Just another systems language > Strict yet helpful complier > Intricate language design > Intutive internal impl details > Safer and faster code > Efficient and less buggy programs > Lesser so called delays (memory leaks) in software as well as hardware > You never get stuck on a lift again ~ You're metro never has delays leading to you being late for work > You happy overall :)

P.S. The creator of Rust did get stuck on a lift and had to take the stairs for 22 floors!
