# Rewrite to rust

(Re)writing stuff in/to rust, cause why not?

## Why Rust?

Software job > Just another systems language > Strict yet helpful complier > Intricate language design > Intutive internal impl details > Safer and faster code > Efficient and less buggy programs > Lesser so called delays (memory leaks) in software as well as hardware > You never get stuck on a lift again ~ You're metro never has delays leading to you being late for work > Your life happier and better overall :)

P.S. The creator of Rust did get stuck on a elevator following which he had to take the stairs all the way up to 22 floors!On his way up, whilst he was blaming the buggy elevator software and imagining the possible memory leakage issues that caused the system to fail in the first place; he was stuck by a desire to make a language which leaves no possibility of introducing such leakages in the first place! And hence Rust was born.
